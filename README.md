Programming Experience: Classtime/ passion project


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


Last year, we learned about the initial functions and rules of python, and started to make programs. We then moved on to more complex programs, and began to get the hang of it 
and develop our own code. At the end of the year, we were able to almost fully develop our own program, and understand all of the rules of python, however I 
was not great at it, and was not able to make a very great program.




10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


This year, we started going into more complexity in python, and learning how you can apply it to different apps and games. We learned how to display certain things on a screen, 
and how python is decyphered and then displayed on a screen. We then learned more complex functions that use things like lists and other data to perform a function.
In my passion project, I learned the functions of discord, and how you can manipulate python and upload it so that these packages can be used on discord, which was very cool.




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


I want to improve on being able to understand the formatting of python, and learn how to type python more fluently so that I can create more complex code without help.

What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


I think that I am challenged with lists and how they are organized because I can not understand how to use them to print certain data that I want to find.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

My goal for programming or computational thinking is to become almost fluent at it and be able to make a file from scratch instead of with help from the internet or a teacher.
